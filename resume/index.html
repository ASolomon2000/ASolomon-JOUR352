<div class="jobtitle">Freelance Reporter</div>
<div class="organization">University of Maryland Diamondback Newspaper</div>
<div class="date">February 2021 - April 2021</div>
<p class="description">When Aiesha Solomon was a freelance reporter for the Diamondback newspaper, she wrote 
    stories for the General Assignments desk where they would give out pitches to and accept 
    pitches from students. She wrote stories on multiple stories of differing topics, like events and 
    technology, for the online newspaper during the Spring 2021 semester. While she was working 
    for the Diamondback, the whole school was still in virtual mode because of COVID-19 
    pandemic so I did my writing, research and interviewing when the school was still in lockdown, 
    on a tight deadline and under pressure from classes.</p>
<div class="jobtitle">Senior Staff Member and Associate Editor</div>
<div class="organization">Montgomery College Rockville Campus Advocate Newspaper</div>

<p class="description">Aiesha Solomon started as a staff writer, but got promoted to senior staff member within a few 
    semesters. After gaining more experience, she worked with the Editor-in-Chief at the time and 
    became the Associate Editor, the second-in-charge editor of the paper. She wrote about 
    international news after a winter vacation trip to the Philippines until the COVID-19 pandemic 
    started, as well as events, features and on-campus news stories.</p>

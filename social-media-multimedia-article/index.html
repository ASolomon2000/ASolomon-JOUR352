    <p>Mona, a tech executive in Boston, stopped using Facebook during the pandemic. 
    She felt the posts she was seeing were incongruous with what was happening in the outside world.</p>

    <p>“‘Look at me doing my Peloton workout’ or ‘Look at me, I got in shape,’” she mimicked. 
    “Do you realize half a million people died?” said Mona, who asked us not to use her last 
    name so she wouldn’t need permission from her job. Mona added that she thought the situation
    was especially bad in tech circles, where she sees a lack of “systems thinking.”</p>
    
    <p>“It feels so silly to show happy stories in a pandemic,” Mona said. “Everything feels inappropriate.”</p>
    
    <p>What’s appropriate and not for social media has changed a lot in the past year. 
    One hard truth of the pandemic was that, in order to someday be together safely, 
    we had to be apart in the meantime. For many, this meant that social media has 
    become one of the only ways to be with friends and family, so people have flocked 
    to platforms new (TikTok) and old (Facebook). The new normal, where many more of 
    our daily interactions are mediated by screens, has made us change the way we behave 
    on those platforms, with the messiness and realities of pandemic life crowding out 
    some of social media’s posturing and perfection.</p>
    
    <p>These sites have been a social lifeline as well as a way to get new information about 
    the disease spreading across the globe and upending life as we knew it. Twitter, especially, 
    shone as a real-time news source. The pandemic made social media, whose utility had languished 
    and whose user growth was in decline, suddenly relevant. Some even mused that social media, though 
    still under intense scrutiny for spreading misinformation and general toxicity, was good again. 
    After years of social fragmentation, during which people were less likely to have watched the same 
    shows or even share the same reality, people suddenly had something they could all talk about.</p>

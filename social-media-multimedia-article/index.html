    She felt the posts she was seeing were incongruous with what was happening in the outside world.</p>

    <p>“‘Look at me doing my Peloton workout’ or ‘Look at me, I got in shape,’” she mimicked. 
    “Do you realize half a million people died?” said Mona, who asked us not to use her last 
    name so she wouldn’t need permission from her job. Mona added that she thought the situation
    was especially bad in tech circles, where she sees a lack of “systems thinking.”</p>
    
    <p>“It feels so silly to show happy stories in a pandemic,” Mona said. “Everything feels inappropriate.”</p>

    <br>
    <p>What’s appropriate and not for social media has changed a lot in the past year. 
    One hard truth of the pandemic was that, in order to someday be together safely, 
    we had to be apart in the meantime. For many, this meant that social media has 
    become one of the only ways to be with friends and family, so people have flocked 
    to platforms new (TikTok) and old (Facebook). The new normal, where many more of 
    our daily interactions are mediated by screens, has made us change the way we behave 
    on those platforms, with the messiness and realities of pandemic life crowding out 
    some of social media’s posturing and perfection.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>These sites have been a social lifeline as well as a way to get new information about 
    the disease spreading across the globe and upending life as we knew it. Twitter, especially, 
    shone as a real-time news source. The pandemic made social media, whose utility had languished 
    and whose user growth was in decline, suddenly relevant. Some even mused that social media, though 
    still under intense scrutiny for spreading misinformation and general toxicity, was good again. 
    After years of social fragmentation, during which people were less likely to have watched the same 
    shows or even share the same reality, people suddenly had something they could all talk about.</p>

    <p>“One thing that brings people together is shared experiences,” Karen North, a clinical professor 
    of digital social media at the University of Southern California, told Recode. “All of a sudden we 
    all have a shared experience.”</p>

    <p>Americans spent on average 82 minutes per day on social media in 2020, a seven-minute jump from 2019 
    and a large upward revision from eMarketer’s original forecast. The media measurement firm previously 
    estimated that time spent on social media would remain the same. But in 2020, concerns about screen time — 
    and “time well spent” — went out the window.</p>

    <p>What’s less clear is whether or not people are posting more, but it seems to vary by person and platform. 
    We asked Vox readers and people on our own social feeds to tell us how they use social media differently 
    now compared to before the pandemic and received dozens of thoughtful responses about how that relationship 
    has changed.</p>

    <p>Some people told us that while they’re scrolling on social media more, they’re posting less — indeed, what’s 
    there to post about when you’re stuck at home doing the same stuff over and over? Commonly shared milestones 
    like birthdays and weddings were postponed or downsized, and people fear coming off as celebratory when there’s 
    so much suffering, or at least so much judgment.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <br>

    <p>But some say they’re posting to social media more, as an outlet for pent-up creativity and an anodyne to the 
    lethargy, loneliness, and boredom of isolation.</p>

    <p>“The ability to connect via so many different platforms not only helps alleviate feelings of isolation but 
    increases the sense of psychological comfort,” said Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research 
    Center. “It makes people feel less lonely and less fearful to know they aren’t dealing with this alone.”</p>

    <p>Others found that social media helped them feel like they could do something about what was happening in the 
    outside world.</p>

    <p>Jordan Updike, a digital marketer in Indianapolis, Indiana, who “went from barely online to very online 
    in a blink,” tried to convince people in his hometown about the realities of the coronavirus.</p>

    <p>“They were coming from the foregone conclusion that this isn’t big deal,” said Updike, who had Covid-19 
    early in the pandemic and is still suffering from lung and heart damage a year later.</p>

    <p>He previously treated personal time on social media “not as time well spent,” but that changed during the pandemic.</p>

    <p>“I realized even if I have conversations with one person, there were hundreds if not thousands of people 
    observing that conversation,” Updike told Recode. “If it meant 20 people changing their minds or taking 
    this thing seriously, I felt that that was time well spent.”</p>

    <p>All of this, of course, was happening amid historic events that also unfolded, at least in part, online. 
    Black Lives Matter organized record turnout to protests against police violence, using social media sites 
    and messaging platforms. By similar means, Capitol rioters plotted their deadly insurrection, egged on by 
    tweets from former President Donald Trump. More recently, people on Reddit’s trading forum WallStreetBets 
    brought about the astronomical rise — and fall — of GameStop and other meme stocks, upending previous 
    conceptions of Wall Street in the process.</p>

    <p>Many readers reported extremes in their social media use: periods of constant usage that ultimately led 
    them to feel overwhelmed or anxious, which resulted in cutting off social media usage altogether.</p>

    <p>“I found myself feeling insanely guilty and anxious,” Matthew Kiernan, a teacher in Florida who has stopped 
    using Facebook and Instagram, told Recode. “I’m a member of a lot of education pages and groups, and so people 
    seemed to be doing a lot of performative posting about the wonderful things they were doing in their classrooms 
    with their students virtually. That didn’t really resonate with me because I truly felt like even attempting to 
    do some of that was driving me insane.”</p>

    <p>Working at a Title I school, Kiernan said, he was more concerned with making sure his students had a good enough 
    broadband connection to access his lessons and with addressing their mental states, which suffered from living 
    in a time with ever-present death.</p>

    <p>The urge to delete social media has, ironically, been very evident on social media, where people have been 
    increasingly talking about deleting their accounts, according to social listening company Brandwatch. July 
    2020 by far had a record number of monthly mentions of deleting social media, according to the company’s data, 
    and rates remain accelerated. Part of that fatigue has to do with the fact that, while a good erstwhile replacement, 
    social media is not as rewarding as face-to-face social interactions, according to Kellan Terry, Brandwatch’s director 
    of communications.</p>

    <p>“In the pandemic we’re constantly looking for that social stimulation,” Terry said. “Social media somewhat filled 
    the gap but not wholly.”</p>

    <p>Fatigue was also a result of the pandemic lasting just way too long.</p>

    <p>“There was a sense that we’d come out the other side,” Lore Oxford, global head of cultural insights at social 
    marketing agency We Are Social, told Recode. “When that didn’t happen, people got overwhelmed.”</p>

    <p>And 2020 was a really bad year for misinformation, with fights over politics and lockdown measures and 
    mask-wearing all playing out on social media, and making it an even more toxic environment. Conspiracy 
    theories that proliferated on social media caused real-life harm and turned many people off from it.</p>

    <p>But complaints and posts decrying social media aside, overall visits to all major social media sites 
    have continued to grow since the onset of the pandemic, according to data from SimilarWeb, which found 
    visits to major social sites still far above 2019 levels. Even if we don’t like it, we had nothing better to do.</p>

    <p>User growth was most dramatic on sites like TikTok and other social video platforms — what eMarketer principal 
    analyst Debra Aho Williamson refers to as “social entertainment.” She says TikTok’s rise was in part a reaction 
    to the negativity on Facebook, including polarization and rampant misinformation.</p>

    <p>According to data from customer experience management software company Sprinklr, nearly three-quarters of mentions 
    of “social media” on social media and news sites in the last year had negative sentiment. In contrast, the majority 
    of mentions of TikTok were positive.</p>

    <p>“People were looking for something to entertain themselves and not finding it as easily on platforms like Facebook,” 
    Williamson said, noting that TikTok encourages more levity. “It forms connections in a different way, watching strangers 
    talking openly about their lives.”</p>

    <p>Indeed, that openness and authenticity has become one of the key hallmarks of social media in the Covid-19 era.</p>

    <p>The pandemic has generally accelerated existing trends like working from home and shopping online. Another trend 
    that sped up is the reversal, in some cases, of social media as an aspirational place of perfection. Whereas social 
    media posts, especially grid photos on Instagram, have long been criticized for their unrealistic and idealized portrayal 
    of people’s lives, there was less of that during the pandemic. Instead, things got a little sloppier: Houses were a mess, 
    children were home and misbehaved, people didn’t wear makeup. And some of that made it to social media feeds.</p>

    <br>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>“The less polished, more real side is appealing and is going to stay,” eMarketer’s Williamson argued. “The idea of the 
    airbrushed, perfect influencer is probably a thing of the past.”</p>

    <p>Nadia Ahmed, a sexual health physician in London who’s alternated overuse with deleting her accounts completely, told 
    Recode, “I’ve also tried to not look at influencer accounts as much. In fact, barely, because it upsets me big time.”</p>

    <p>Oxford, from We Are Social, said she’s noticed fewer posts on Instagram’s grid. When people do post there, she says 
    the posts feel more intimate and introspective than they had been.</p>

    <p>Many have abstained from posting to not give the impression they were doing something they shouldn’t be — eating 
    in crowded restaurants, hanging out in large groups — during the pandemic. When people do post outside of their 
    homes, it’s often accompanied by a disclaimer that the activity was “Covid safe,” and the fear of being shamed 
    in the comments is almost palpable. Indeed, many readers told Recode they avoided sites like Instagram because 
    posts of people having fun and acting like there wasn’t a pandemic made them anxious and angry.</p>
    
    <p>At the same time, some people have found solace in social platforms’ seeming move to more honesty, with people 
    expressing disappointment and negativity, and complaints about isolation and the state of the world.</p>

    <p>“People really want to share thoughts like that when people are similarly afflicted and right now everyone is 
    miserable,” said North, the USC professor, saying that it’s a welcome development for many people who’ve had these 
    thoughts but may have avoided voicing them on social media.</p>

    <p>“The pandemic has normalized the negative side of life,” North said.</p>

    <p>Social media has also proliferated with posts about people’s deteriorated mental health and sensitivity to others’ 
    problems. Social justice slide shows dominated Instagram Stories, as people sought to take social justice actions 
    online or at least learn about everything from defunding the police to mail-in voting to combating racism.</p>

    <h5 id="second-subheading">Growth in Popular Social Media Platforms</h5>
    <br>
    <br>

    </script>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><span class="first-letter">I</span>nevitably, the platforms and types of content that people took comfort in during the pandemic were 
    ones that felt the most real. People have reacted well to TikTok’s format, in which people add their 
    own imperfect variations to viral videos. It also doesn’t hurt that TikTok videos are relatively short, 
    which many people have found appealing.</p>

    <p>Visits to TikTok’s website grew nearly 600 percent on average in 2020 compared to the year before, 
    according to SimilarWeb. Meanwhile, visits to Instagram were up 43 percent, Twitter 36 percent, and 3 
    percent for Facebook, which is still impressive considering how massively popular the site already was. 
    Average users now spend almost as much time per day on TikTok as they do on the No. 1 social site, Facebook, 
    according to eMarketer data.</p>

    <p>Disappearing posts like those pioneered by Snapchat have been particularly useful, since they lower the bar 
    for how good or polished content had to be. Similarly, many people took to live-streaming on various platforms, 
    where their unedited, real-time posts felt immediate and more authentic.</p>

    <p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) livestreamed herself playing the popular video game Among Us on Twitch in 
    order to get people to vote. Parenting accounts use Instagram Live to show their followers what living with children 
    in the pandemic is really like. Friends livestream everything from stand-up comedy routines to cooking dinner.</p>

    <p>The pandemic also saw people move increasingly to messaging apps or the messaging portion of other social apps, 
    to create a more intimate setting.</p>

    <p>“When so much more of our lives are online, we can retreat into slightly more private spaces,” said Oxford. 
    “Facebook was the public square. Groups and chats and Reddit are the bars and the clubs and community centers.”</p>

    <p>She noted that US influencers saw a 100 percent growth in Instagram interactions in the week following lockdown orders. 
    Their followers messaged them directly to see how they were holding up and to assuage their own loneliness.</p>

    <p>During the pandemic, people have also flocked to niche social media based around common interests or other activities, 
    what some refer to as social+. There people could find more meaningful connections than they could on general social media, 
    with sites like Clubhouse, Nextdoor, and Goodreads all gaining traction.</p>

    <p>Viewership of sites like Twitch and Facebook Gaming, where people can watch and communicate with others play video games, 
    nearly doubled during the pandemic. Usership of Fishbrain, a social network for anglers, grew more than 60 percent in the US 
    in 2020, bringing its American user base to 8.5 million.</p>


    <h5 id="third-subheading">What Can We See in the Future of Social Media</h5>

    <p><span class="first-letter">L</span>ivestreaming and social entertainment sites like TikTok will continue to grow as the pandemic continues, 
    eMarketer predicts. The firm estimates that while time spent on social media might dip a little bit in the 
    coming years, it will remain higher than before the pandemic.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "We shouldn't use social media to reproduce pre-pandemic normality, we should be using it to create a new normal," --- Thomas Roach, a professor of cultural studies at Bryant University said.
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the meantime, social media has become more embedded in our lives than ever, and the increased reliance 
    we’ve developed in the last year is likely here to stay.</p>

    <p>“It’s hard to change a habit,” said Shaka McGlotten, a professor of media studies and anthropology at 
    SUNY Purchase College. Still, McGlotten thinks there’s a chance for change. “I do think that there is 
    going to be a kind of reckoning when we can go outside.”</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <iframe title="Percentage of United States Internet Usage Penetration Rate by State, from November 2021 " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-Mr8W3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Mr8W3/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="571" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
    </script>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What’s certain to gradually change is how we behave on social media, as our actions morph to meet our needs. 
    Those who’ve felt like they have a toxic relationship with social media may have the chance to break out of 
    bad habits, says Thomas Roach, a professor of cultural studies at Bryant University who recently wrote a book 
    about intimacy on Grindr. It’s possible to embrace the alienation of being just a box on a screen: Instead of 
    constant branding ourselves as individuals, it can be liberating to be one of the crowd, he said. </p>

    <p>“We shouldn’t use social media to reproduce pre-pandemic normality, we should be using it to create a new normal,” 
    Roach said.</p>

    <p>As one Recode reader expressed, living through this pandemic could change our relationship with social media 
    for the better.</p>

    <p>“Last year, I used social media to keep tabs on how our country was dying,” she wrote. 
    “This year, I use it to look for signs of life.”</p>

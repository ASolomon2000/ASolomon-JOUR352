    Maryland College Park. She transferred into the Journalism major from Montgomery College in 
    Rockville. She graduated in May 2023. She has worked for multiple school 
    publications in her time as a journalist starting from her sophomore year of high school. 
    She is an intern with a Laurel, MD newspaper called The Laurel Independent, which she has been 
    working for since September 2022 to December 2022 and then from June 2023 to Present. In the future, 
    she hopes to work as an international news reporter, writer and photojournalist.</p>

<p class="description">While working for the Laurel Independent, Aiesha Solomon has learned more about meeting deadlines, 
     researching, photojournalism, photo editing and contacting sources. Meeting deadlines was a skill she had already been taught at school, but this 
    internship gives her a feel for what it would be like to utilize that skill in a professional environment where her work 
    is actually going to be seen by more readers than just a professor. The pressure of meeting deadlines pushes her to 
    make sure the writing is as best as it can be.</p>

<p class="description">When Aiesha Solomon was a freelance reporter for the Diamondback newspaper, she wrote 
    stories for the General Assignments desk where they would give out pitches to and accept 
    pitches from students. She wrote stories on multiple stories of differing topics, like events and 
    technology, for the online newspaper during the Spring 2021 semester. While she was working 
    for the Diamondback, the whole school was still in virtual mode because of COVID-19 
    pandemic so I did my writing, research and interviewing when the school was still in lockdown, 
    on a tight deadline and under pressure from classes.</p>

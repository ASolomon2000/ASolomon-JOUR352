<p id="top1" class="top">Aiesha Solomon is a journalism major and creative minor in her senior year at University of 
    Maryland College Park. She transferred into the Journalism major from Montgomery College in 
    Rockville. She is working towards graduating in May 2023. She has worked for multiple school 
    publications in her time as a journalist starting from her sophomore year of high school. She will 
    be starting an internship with a Laurel, MD newspaper called the Laurel Independent this fall 
    2022 semester. In the future, she hopes to work as an international news reporter, writer and 
    photojournalist.</p>
<div id="sectionheader1" class="sectionheader">Experience:</div>
<div class="jobtitle">Intern Reporter, Writer and Photographer</div>
<div class="organization">Laurel Independent Newspaper</div>
<div class="date">September 2022 - Present</div>
<p class="description">While working for the Laurel Independent, Aiesha Solomon has learned more about meeting deadlines 
    and researching and contacting sources. Meeting deadlines was a skill she had already been taught at school, but this 
    internship gave her a feel for what it would be like to utilize that skill in a professional environment where her work 
    is actually going to be seen by more readers than just a professor. The pressure of meeting a deadline has pushed her to 
    make sure my writing is as best as it can be when I submit a story.</p>
<div class="jobtitle">Freelance Reporter</div>
<div class="organization">University of Maryland Diamondback Newspaper</div>
<div class="date">February 2021 - April 2021</div>
<p class="description">When Aiesha Solomon was a freelance reporter for the Diamondback newspaper, she wrote 
    stories for the General Assignments desk where they would give out pitches to and accept 
    pitches from students. She wrote stories on multiple stories of differing topics, like events and 
    technology, for the online newspaper during the Spring 2021 semester. While she was working 
    for the Diamondback, the whole school was still in virtual mode because of COVID-19 
    pandemic so I did my writing, research and interviewing when the school was still in lockdown, 
    on a tight deadline and under pressure from classes.</p>
<div class="jobtitle">Senior Staff Member and Associate Editor</div>
<div class="organization">Montgomery College Rockville Campus Advocate Newspaper</div>
<div class="date">2019 - 2020</div>
<p class="description">Aiesha Solomon started as a staff writer, but got promoted to senior staff member within a few 
    semesters. After gaining more experience, she worked with the Editor-in-Chief at the time and 
    became the Associate Editor, the second-in-charge editor of the paper. She wrote about 
    international news after a winter vacation trip to the Philippines until the COVID-19 pandemic 
    started, as well as events, features and on-campus news stories.</p>
